# NeoPixel Matrix Control with PIC Microcontroller

This project is part of a college subject and demonstrates how to control a 16x16 NeoPixel matrix using a PIC microcontroller to display a simple animation of Charmander. The code is written in MikroC Pro for PIC and is designed to work with a specific hardware setup.

The project's main difficulty was optimizing the code to ensure it met the time specifications required by the WS2812B NeoPixel datasheet.
